# Dynamic Network of Speakers

This project holds a Dynamic Network of Speakers.

The goal for this project is to create a system where a user can setup speakers
and tell via a website what sound comes out of each speaker. All the speakers
are connected via the internet and are talking with each other via a protocol
called [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/).
