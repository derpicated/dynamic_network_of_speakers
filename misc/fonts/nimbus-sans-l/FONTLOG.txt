  29 Jun 2002 (Owen Taylor)

- the hints on Nimbus Sans Regular have been modified in
  the following ways:
- removed odd vertical stem hints (width of horizontal
  stems) from f, F, t, E, yen sign, fi ligature, fl ligature,
  AE ligature, R, Lstroke, OE ligature, lstroke, E+ACIA
  variants, t, variants, Eth, Dstoke, etc.
- fixed hints on 1 to be two ghost hints instead of one
  hint the height of the font
- fix bottom stem of u to have integer coordinates

- The hints on Nimbus Mono L Oblique have been modified in
  the following ways:
- removed vertical stem hints from horizontal serifs on
  roman characters.

  25 Jun 2002 (Owen Taylor)
- the hints on Nimbus Sans Regular have been modified in
  the following ways:
- added ghost hint to the top of 4 to keep it from being
  taller than the other digits.
- reduced the width of the left stem hint for H to 83
  (probably no real differences)
- changed the StemSnapV values from [78 85 94] to [78 83
  92] (and fixed up StdVW accordingly) This corresponds to
  the values in the font (which are 83/93
  for lower case and upper case stems) better and makes the
  width-88 stems on M and N snap to to upper case widths not
  lower-case widths.
